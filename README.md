# NashvillehousingDataCleaning
The Nashville housing market was absolutely thriving in 2016.  By the end of the second quarter the three year appreciation rate was at nearly 30% for home owners.
This makes the data surrounding that time period interesting to analize.  This data was retrieved from Kaggle Website. I have cleaned the data using Microsoft SSMS.

Will update soon with analysis.
