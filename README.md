# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
The Nashville housing market was absolutely thriving in 2016.  By the end of the second quarter the three-year appreciation rate was at nearly 30% for homeowners.
This makes the data surrounding that time period interesting to analize.  This data was retrieved from Kaggle Website and contains data on the Nashville housing market from 2013-2016. I have cleaned the data using Microsoft SSMS.

Right now if you look I am trying to see how best to show Power BI dashboards in Github so excuse the trial and error.

Will update soon with regression analysis and possible time series analysis.
